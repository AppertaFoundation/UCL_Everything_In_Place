        If you do not make your wishes clear about the type of funeral you want, the decision will be left to your family, they may be upset and vulnerable and not in a good place to make decisions. This can create conflict and upset and you could end up with a funeral that does not reflect you or your likes and dislikes.

      <p>
        The average funeral cost has risen beyond the rate of inflation. According to the Co-operative Funeral Service the average cost of a funeral in 2007 was £2,269, by 2015 this had increased to £3,609. If funeral  costs  continue to  rise at  this rate, the average funeral could cost over £5,000 by 2021. The cost of a funeral is usually made up of two parts, disbursements and undertaker’s fees.<br><br>

        Funerals have no legal status, so you can be as creative as you want to be and it is your choice whether you would like a religious or non-religious service. The undertaker will make the arrangements for you. Traditionally the norm was a religious service, lead by the local Vicar, but if you are not sure what type of service you would like take some time to consider the options.

        The humanist funeral will express sadness for the loss, but is very much focused on the celebration of a human life, for more information visit www.humanism.org.uk

      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">

        A civil ceremony sits between a religious funeral and a humanist funeral, and is driven by the wishes and beliefs of the deceased and their family. The Institute of Civil Funerals can provide information on what a civil ceremony is, and details of  a qualified celebrant who could speak at the funeral. For more details see the Institute of Civil Funerals website (IoCF) www.iocf.org.uk

        If you are planning only to attend the crematorium is it not essential to have a vicar or religious speaker. A family member could conduct the service or the undertaker may be happy to oblige. If you prefer a religious service it may include going to church first and then a burial or cremation, or going straight to the crematorium with a memorial service in church, it is up to you.

        Start here to gather your thoughts. Think about what is important to you and your family and don't be swayed by a good salesman. Undertakers are businessmen, running a business, it is ok to ask for a quote and compare services and charges.

        Many undertakers, banks and building societies offer a funeral planning or pre-payment plan service. There are a wide range of services, in many cases it depends on your priorities. It is essential that you take time to plan and think about your funeral wishes. It is also worth using the internet to search for different options.

        Funeral plans usually include an administration fee, and the costs are slightly inflated (as they would be with any price guarantee scheme). Pre-payment plans in general offer 3 levels of cover, around £3500 for basic, £4000 for mid range, and £4500 for top level, however they do not include the cost of a church service, and some cheaper plans do not include the cost of cremation.

        <b>It is essential you understand what is included in your plan, and purchase the plan that meets your needs.</b> If a death is imminent and expected within the next 12 to 24 months, and the money is readily available, then the advice would be not to purchase a plan but just pay the actual costs when the time comes.

        Most plans offer a choice of payment methods, but will add interest if the plan is taken over 5 years. Many plans will allow an interest free option if paid for over 12 monthsude the cost of a church service, and some cheaper plans do not include the cost of cremation.

        If you buy a plan, you will secure the undertakers element of the bill at todays prices. However read the small print, as many of the packages state that whenever the funeral is held, (especially if 15 or 20 years down the line) the disbursement element may have increased, leaving your family with additional costs. These disbursement costs are out of the remit of the undertaker with charges set by local authority. There are plans available that cover 100% of the disbursement costs but they are slightly more expensive to purchase.

      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        Plans are available with 2 names for the price of 1, you and your partner/spouse each plan your own arrangements and the plan has both names on. The cost of the first death is covered. The cost of the second funeral can then be taken from the estate without leaving one partner vulnerable.

        It is important to read the small print in the plans, as some cover removal of a body from within the UK for others this would be an additional cost, therefore you really must take your lifestyle into consideration when planning.

        We advise that you take time to think about and plan your funeral down to the last detail. It sounds difficult, but we advise that you get 3 quotes on a like for like basis, talk to the undertakers regarding which finance companies they work with and make sure all costs are included, or at least be clear about any exclusions.

        It is usual practice for undertakers to charge a deposit when making funeral arrangements, this can be up to half of the expected final bill. Arrangements can be delayed until the deposit is paid which can come as a shock to many families.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        If your estate has insufficient funds to cover the cost of your funeral, whoever makes the arrangements will be responsible for the cost. This can bring additional worries to grieving families, and makes it a sensible option to plan ahead.

      <p>
        In order to get a true cost comparison get a like for like quote, do no let the undertaker persuade you to buy more than you need. Buying a funeral is a business decision like buying a TV or a kitchen. Be very clear about your preferences and then compare cost.

      5.9 | Life and funeral insurance policies
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        Also known as over-50s plans, these pay out a lump sum on your death. Unlike pre-paid plans, your family will have to arrange your funeral. Insurance costs are usually spread over many years and you could pay much more in monthly premiums than the policy will pay out.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        For example, a 69 year old man paying £11.95 a month could currently have a life policy for £6,000, you could pay less in monthly payments. The total amount paid in premiums up to age 90 in this instance is £3011.40. If death occurs before then the full £6000 is paid out. After his 90th birthday the policy lapses and there is no payment out. Thus if death occurs before age 90 he will have paid less in than would be received. If he dies after 90 then everything is lost.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        If you take out an insurance whilst working it is extremely important to think about how you will make the payments when you retire. If you have paid the premiums for 20 years and then cannot afford them when you retire the policy will lapse. Please note this is an example only and in every case it is dependent on the health and age of each individual.

        Anyone interested in an over 50 insurance or funeral plan insurance (which follows a similar model) should ensure a personal quotation is obtained and seek advice if unsure.

    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        “Funeral Poverty” is on the increase, as families find it harder and harder to give their loved one a fitting send off. Whoever arranges the funeral will be personally responsible for the payment of the bill. If the deceased persons estate is very small and there is concern there may be difficulty paying for a funeral, discuss the problem with the undertaker when arranging the funeral, they may be able to ‘scale down’ the arrangements. Many of the changes would be so small that no one attending the funeral would notice, but it saves on additional costs.

        Whether expected or totally out of the blue, the death of a loved one can send you into turmoil. If your spouse or partner had made a choice to die at home it is likely that you will be receiving support from the community medical team, doctors, nurses etc. The professionals will be able to support you through the process and prepare you the best they can for the impending death. You may like to have a discussion with medical practitioners about what you might expect to see and hear. Death is seldom like the movies, so it is best that you have an idea of what to expect, there are many signs that death might be close, such as:

        It is distressing and exhausting to care for someone in their last few days or hours, as caring human beings we want to feed and care for our loved ones. We can become frustrated if they are not eating or drinking. Be patient with them, it may be difficult for them to swallow, try to remember that they are not eating because they are dying, they are not dying because they are not eating. If you are unsure and need help and reassurance you can call Macmillan Nurses or the Marie Curie rapid response teams who should be able to advise.

      <p>
        The registrar will also offer you the ‘tell us once’ service whereby the information you provide is passed electronically (with your permission) to all other relevant Government and Local Authority departments. Take with you (if relevant) driving licence, passport, tax reference number, national insurance number, NHS number, blue badge etc. They will also contact the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to cancel any benefits of the deceased and review any additional benefits for surviving relatives. In order to use this service the registrar will need the surviving spouse’s national insurance number.
