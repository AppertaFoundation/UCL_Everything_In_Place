    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        It is increasingly common that we choose to store our personal information digitally. It is important to think not only about the information our family or Executor might need when we can no longer direct them to it.  Serious consideration needs to be given not only to its safety but also accessible storage.

        Many people now keep a record solely for this purpose, creating a word document or a spread sheet.  Think of anything that would be useful to the Executor to wrap up our financial business.

      <u>Electronic data and passwords</u>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        Electronic data can be stored in many different ways, when thinking about storage consideration must be given to whether the method used will stand the test of time. It needs to be secure, it needs to remain in an original format, be accessible and continue to be protected and preserved until needed.  Information will need to be updated at the time of any significant changes, in investments, bank accounts or personal situation.  This should be done at least on an annual basis, if you were to suffer a long illness, and were not able, it is worth thinking about whether anyone else in your family could do this for you.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        Would your storage method become outdated?  Would disks become so old that a new machine might not recognise the contents?  Should it be stored online, offline, on a cloud, on a disk, on a stick or backed up onto a hard drive to name but a few.  To some extent the answer to this is probably down to personal preference, but how and where you choose to store your digital information could affect its viability over time.

      <u>Three most popular methods of storage:</u>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content text-center>
      <p>
        <b>Online</b> - through storage hosted through the internet, for example cloud storage.  This is usually quick and easy to access, and could be accessed by family members in different locations, you do not have to be sitting in front of the laptop to access this information, but you would need email address and password. The password might change regularly, it may be that the passwords are kept somewhere else in a safe and accessible manner
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        <b>Offline</b> – on a local drive, on your PC or Laptop, or retrieved through a hard drive back-up device, again the files should be password protected, however, the documents would be accessed through the PC or device. Once again the password might change regularly
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        <b>Removable media</b> – CD’s, DVD’s, and memory cards, flash drives (USB sticks).  These removable storage devices have to be physically located and inserted into a PC or laptop.  The person accessing the information would have to come and physically put the disc or USB stick into the machine or their own.  These removable storage devices should also be password protected, but it is less likely that the password would have to change.

      7.3 | Social media

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        Another side to our digital legacy is the footprint we leave across Social Media or online pages, whether Facebook, Twitter or Instagram are your thing (or indeed many others), then you might like to think about what happens once you no longer exist. <b>You should leave instructions on how you would like your online identity to be handled</b>

      <u>Facebook</u>
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        Facebook allows for you (the individual) to set up a legacy contact – this means that you nominate someone as guardian of your account, after your death.  You should explain to the guardian what it is that you would like them to do, you might want them to:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ion-list>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>

        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>
            ~ Let your friends grieve and share feeling on your page and maybe announce details of the funeral, before deleting your account

        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>
            ~ Keep your account open, let your friend’s tag you in special memories or events that you planned to go to, perhaps for up to a year, and then close the account after the first anniversary of your death.

      <p>
        Some people might find leaving the account open distasteful or disrespectful, whereas younger people may still prefer to use the page as a community for grieving.  If you are going to nominate someone, or if someone nominates you, then you deserve a conversation to understand the individual wishes.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        Once your account is ‘memorialised’ the nominated person can add a post for your profile, respond to new friend requests (but not old ones), update our profile picture and cover photos.  They cannot log into your account, remove or change past posts, read your personal messages or remove any of your friend

        In the event of the death of a Twitter user, Twitter can work with a person authorised to act on behalf of the estate, or with a verified immediate family member of the deceased to have an account deactivated.  In the event a Twitter user is incapacitated, due to medical or other reasons, Twitter can work with a person authorised to act on the behalf of the user to have an account deactivated.

        Once you have finalised and paid the balance on utility accounts, council tax, phone bills etc. you can ask that the online accounts are closed down – this would usually happen especially if the responsibility for paying them transfers to another person.
