            Having a medical condition or being over a certain age does not necessarily prevent you from becoming a donor. However this will be decided by a healthcare professional on a case by case basis at the time of death. The removal of organs is carried out with the same care and respect as any other operation, and does not cause any delay to the funeral arrangements.  Please tick as appropriate.

            Medical research is  vital to the progression of science and medical interventions. Education facilities use donated bodies for scientific research and development. It can be a controversial subject for families, to think the remains of their loved one is being used in such a way. There should be a number of things taken into consideration if this is a realistic possibility for you.

            •	You cannot volunteer to donate your body to medical science if you have already elected to donate your organs.  You can only choose one or the other.

        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap>
            •	Some medical conditions including CJD, Viral Hepatitis, HIV and Tuberculosis, can prevent acceptance as a donor, as can the existence of some aggressive Cancers. Being over or under the normal weight ranges, or the need for a post mortem can also be reasons for rejection.

        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap>
            •	Body donation removes the need to arrange a funeral. The education facility normally release the body for burial or cremation between 1 and 3 years from time of death and will often hold a memorial service.

            •	Under the Human Tissue Act 2004, written and witnessed consent for anatomical examination must be given prior to death; consent cannot be given by anyone else after your death. A consent form can be obtained from your nearest medical school and a copy should be kept with your Will.

            •	We strongly recommend a discussion with your family and close friends as many people find the ‘not knowing’ of what is happening to a loved one to be particularly disturbing. It may take them some time (if indeed they do) to come round to your way of thinking. You should also discuss the subject with your GP, who may be able to help you with the decision.

            Spirituality can be defined in many ways and can mean different things to different people. Spirituality is very personal, it may be linked to religion or a specific culture or for some it may mean being able to gain solace in nature, art or music. Our spirit can be described as that spark of life that is intangible and makes us who we are.

          <p text-wrap text-center>
            Spirituality is often described as making reference to the bigger picture, about searching for the meaning in life, contentment and knowing you live a ‘good life’. Of course this can be found within religion, however religion and spirituality are not the same thing, nor are they entirely distinct from one another, nor do you need to have them both to find inner peace.

            Spirituality is very difficult to define. Whether you believe in following a religious path, or that life takes care of itself, you will have developed a set of beliefs that have helped you on your journey of life, and have got you this far.

            You will know what gives you peace or wears you down. Think about what lifts your mood, walking the dog, music, art, nature, sport, friends, church, use the space to think about what you enjoy.

            As we fight illness, or receive invasive treatments, it is easy to lose sight of what is important. The circles we move in become smaller, closer to home. If you are not able to do the things you enjoy, what are the alternatives? Think about ways you could still be involved in the same activities, but in a different way, for example if you cannot walk the dog, someone might be able to take you out in a wheelchair, and take the dog too.

            If you are a lover of nature and you cannot get out of the house, move a chair to the window and put bird feeders or a birdbath in the garden, where you can see and hear sounds of the countryside. You may not be able to go to the pub and play dominoes but ask family members to sit with you and play dominoes, cards or board games. You might not be able to attend your usual church group, maybe a House group could come to you, or the Minister might bring Communion. The use of meditation or listening to talking books can be relaxing and take you away from your situation.

            In this age of technology, it might seem easy to keep memories alive. We can make short films, take videos on our phones, and could even leave a personal film to be played at our funeral. However, it is very easy for those memories to be lost, the laptop crashes, phones break etc. Without a proper backup system it can all be very fragile. What happens if we suddenly lose capacity due to an accident, stroke or dementia and are unable to organise our own memories, should we think about getting something in order now.

            Each of us have a unique life to celebrate, highs and lows, a life that probably started in a very different world. There are many tools we can use to help us collect our memories and leave them in a logical format that can be remembered for generations to come.

            You might think that children and grandchildren don't seem interested, but they will be as they get older themselves and it all becomes much more relevant. It is very likely they will have questions later in life, that they would not be able to think of at the present time and want answers that can no longer be sought.

            If you don't store your memories safely, they might well end up being thrown away. Family members might keep small items, but wouldn't it be nice to share your story and explain why particular items are so important to you with the thought that they could be passed down the generations to come? We should all be encouraged to celebrate our unique life.

            <b>Memory boxes </b>are an ideal way to keep possessions. Make a family box or one for each of your children with their own stories. You can use a plastic storage box or a nice cardboard box that can be decorated. It is really important to label items, luggage labels can be tied explaining that this was a gift you received from a first school trip, or holiday with friends. Write on the back of photographs, not only who, but where and why or what makes the picture so important.

            <b>Life Story Books </b>are also very popular, and easy to buy on-line. ‘Dear Mum from you to me’ comes in several different family formations, Dads, Brothers, Sisters etc. They can also be searched for under <b>‘Journals of a Lifetime’.</b> These booklets have a series of questions, with blank pages to write your memories. Questions such as “Mum what did you really think of me as I was growing up?” or “Why did you pick the bridesmaids that you had at yours and Dads wedding?”. Of course you could always write stories of your life, memoirs of particular journeys or experiences, being evacuat- ed as a child or having to manage on food rations.
