      <p>
        Powers of Attorney refer to the appointment of a person (an ‘attorney’) to make decisions on your behalf. It is well documented that as an aging population that is living longer, there is an increased risk that we will suffer more medical conditions.

      3.2 | Defining mental capacity
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        The definition of capacity is the ability to make your own decisions. Under UK law capacity is judged according to the specific decision to be made. Someone could have the capacity to make a simple decision, but not more complicated ones.

  </ion-card>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) states that a person lacks capacity to make a decision if they have ‘an impairment or disturbance in the function of their mind or brain’ (either temporary or permanent) and as a result <b>cannot do one or more of the following.</b>

    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        In the past, an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) was advised, allowing someone to make decisions on your behalf and take over the responsibility of your financial affairs. However, on 1st October 2007 the EPA was replaced with the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).

  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        EPAs signed prior to that date are still valid and can be registered but the LPA is far more flexible and you have the option of taking out either a Property and Financial Affairs LPA or a Health and Welfare LPA, or both. EPA’s must be registered before they can be used and apply to property and finance only.

        The LPA for financial decisions allows you (the donor) to appoint an attorney, (or more than one), to manage your property, finances and affairs when today you have the capacity to make your own decisions but remains valid if you lose that capacity. You can limit it to only be used when you lack capacity, i.e. if you can manage things yourself then you continue do so. It also offers the option of giving your attorney the power to make decisions about part, or all, of your property and financial affairs.

        Unlike the EPA, the new LPA requires that the person making the LPA is certified to have the mental capacity to do so, confirming they are preparing and signing the document without being subjected to any pressure or fraud. The certificate provider or witness of the new LPA must complete a statement to that effect, stating that he or she has discussed the LPA with the person making the LPA and is satisfied the person understands the scope and purpose of the LPA, and is under no undue pressure to make it.

      3.8 | Who can be an attorney
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        The role of attorney  involves a great deal of power and responsibility, it is very important that you choose the right person. Your attorney could be a family member, friend, spouse, partner or civil partner or someone you know well. <br><br><b>
          However if you are using a professional, it is really important to check with them whether they would charge a fee to address any issues that might arise in the future.

      <p>
        For example if a decision is needed regarding choosing a care home, a Solicitor can charge a normal hourly rate whilst carrying out this function, realistically this could be many hours. Your attorney can claim back any expenses they incur as a result of their role as your attorney, as long as they keep accounts and receipts so it is important to consider whether appointing a professional may incur large costs and eventually devalue your estate.

      3.10 | Planning for your LPA
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        An LPA is by the far the easiest (legal way) of giving someone else responsibility for your decisions. Without appointing an LPA you could be left in a position where your accounts will be frozen and nothing released until the Court of Protection can appoint someone, this is a costly and time consuming process.  (So please think carefully especially if you own property.)

  </ion-card>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        If you have not yet prepared your LPA, it is wise to have conversations with the people that you would like to act on your behalf? You should ask them if they are willing to take on this role, talk things through with them about your expectations and what they would need to do. You need to be sure they understand your wishes. Think about the following whilst planning your LPA.

      Things to Consider
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <p>
        Consider whether you may need to appoint replacement attorneys in case anything should happen to your original choices. If your appointed attorneys become unable to act, or if they are only allowed to make decisions jointly and one becomes unable to act, the other cannot act alone. If you do not have any replacements, then you would have to go through the whole process of appointing new ones. This would incur additional costs, but would not be possible if you had already lost capacity.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        Consider whether you would like to impose a condition where the LPA is not valid unless mental capacity is lost. The health LPA is only valid if and when capacity is lost. However with the Financial LPA, you will need to decide when the LPA should become effective. If you decide it should be when capacity is lost, it is important to understand that defining loss of capacity can be difficult to prove, it may mean that your attorneys cannot act immediately as you would wish. If you trust your attorneys, (as you should) it may be better to register the document to become valid immediately, but in reality for you to continue making your own decisions, then if and when capacity is lost the attorneys can step in immediately.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        Consider whether you might want your health LPA to refuse life sustaining treatment on your behalf. It would never be an easy decision for anyone to make, but giving someone permission now to switch of a machine or refuse an organ transplant, may help relieve the guilt they could feel later; by knowing it was what you would have wanted.

      <ion-list>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>

        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>
            ~ Jointly and severally – where they may act together or separately
        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>
            ~ A mixture of both depending on the type of decision to be made
        </ion-item>
      </ion-list>
      <br>
      <p>
        You must specify in the LPA documents how you want the attorneys to act; maybe jointly for specific decisions such as selling a house and jointly and severally for smaller day to day decisions regarding your care. If you have more than one child it maybe worth appointing them jointly for all decisions, then one cannot act without the other’s consent, you know your family best.

      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        You can put the forms to one side but it is not valid until it is registered, the process of registration can take up to 10 weeks.

      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        If you do not register an LPA of either type and lose mental capacity then the position can become very complicated. Nobody can act for you and generally everything is frozen until a Court of Protection Order has been obtained. This is an expensive process and the Court controls decisions on the release of capital, which can be very stressful and time consuming for the family.
      </p>
      <hr style="visibility:hidden"><hr><hr style="visibility:hidden">
      <p>
        The recommended option is to register the document immediately after it is signed, as everything is then in place. The fee is currently £110 for each Lasting Power of Attorney (with a reduction if in receipt of certain benefits).  You  can  decide whether the financial LPA comes into force straight away or whether you put a clause in that you only want it to become active if and when you lose mental capacity. The Health LPA only becomes active if and when capacity is lost.
