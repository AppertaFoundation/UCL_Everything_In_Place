            Making decisions in advance, anticipating health or aging issues in good time allows

            The process of planning your Preferred Priorities for Care (PPC) can help to clarify your
            thoughts. In the event that capacity may be lost, anyone involved in making decisions on
            your behalf will have access to information regarding your preferred choices and this would
            help them make a <b>best interest decision</b>

            Advance care planning’ is a voluntary process of discussion and review to help an
            individual who has the capacity to anticipate how their condition may affect them in the
            future. It allows you to set on record choices about care or a decision to refuse
            treatment in specific circumstances. The plan can guide carers, so that in the event
            that  the individual loses capacity and illness progresses there is a good understanding
            of what the individual would want to happen.

            To make advance decisions we use the Deciding Right Framework,
            this initiative, developed by the Northern England Strategic Clinical
            Network, to provide a structure for making such decisions, firstly to ensure
            patients make informed choices and secondly that those decisions are documented
            in a uniform manner. More information can be found on the  network’s website.

            This is a written statement about your wishes and feelings regarding
            things you might want to be considered in your future care plans if capacity is lost.
            It is not a legally binding document but the decision makers should take it into consideration

            You might wish to express your preferences around specific beliefs you hold. You might have strong views on your care or where you might like to live. Research has found that certain, familiar things in life give us comfort, and there is evidence based research to show that even when capacity is lost these familiar things can still give us pleasure. For example if you have always had a hot milky drink before bed, and you continue to do so once capacity is lost, you will still experience the pleasure and familiarity from the drink, you may not recognise what it is, and you may not know what you want if asked, but when you are drinking it, it is a familiar comfort.

            This document is a written statement, by an individual with capacity describing his/her wishes, feelings, beliefs and values about future care. An Advance Statement cannot be made on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity to make these decisions for themselves. It only becomes active if/when the individual loses mental capacity. <b>It is not legally binding but carers are bound to take it into account, to make informed choices in regard of any best interest decisions they make.</b>

            Think carefully about your likes and dislikes. For example you might only drink herbal teas or know a particular food will upset your digestion. If you go into care, having suddenly lost capacity (stroke or trauma) staff may have no way of finding out what you enjoy, or have an allergic reaction to, think about the following and make your own list.
            Use the space on the pdf page to think about what your own preferences might be, discuss with family members as they may remember something you have forgotten.

            As your health deteriorates you may want to think about making a legally  binding, advance decision to refuse treatment (ADRT), a decision to refuse specific treatment. The decision must be made in advance, whilst you still have full mental capacity and only applies to a future time when capacity may be lost. Loss of capacity does not only mean dementia or stroke, it can be caused by many conditions, for example you may be unconscious and unable to respond.

            It is very important therefore that you understand the types of treatment you might want to refuse. The making of an advance decision should be done under the guidance of someone who understands how complicated the process is, and knows what the full effect of the decision would mean, it is worth talking to your Doctor or Nurse for more information.

            It may be difficult for you to think that far ahead now, without a full diagnosis it is difficult to think in specific terms. This is a discussion that you might have in due course but it might be helpful to start thinking about it now and talk to your family. The reason most people refuse treatment by making advance decisions, is to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions as they reach the natural end of their life.

            It can be difficult to decide whether to appoint an attorney to make decisions about your life sustaining treatment and possible refusal or whether to complete an advance decision to refuse treatment. As a summary the advance decision to refuse treatment is very specific and can only be used to refuse specific named treatments, the advantage is that it would come into use immediately, without any wait for the registration process.

            If you give your attorneys the permission to make any life sustaining decision on your behalf and you have told them what your preferences are and are confident they will make the right choices, then the LPA is much more flexible, and your attorney can refuse treatment across many levels on your behalf. The valid document is the most recent, so if you already have done an LPA and choose to do an ARDT the most recent will stand.

            Cardiopulmonary arrest is when your heart stops beating and your breathing stops. It is sometimes possible to start it again with a combination of treatments called cardio- pulmonary resuscitation, chest compressions, electric shock treatment and mouth to mouth etc. How well you recover from a cardiac arrest depends on your general health before the attack.

            Following CPR some people make a full recovery however if you have a long term condition or terminal illness it is much less likely to work. Even if CPR is successful it can be a rough procedure, frail bones break easily and it may take a long time to recover. For someone with a life limiting illness, and who is relatively well CPR can be the right decision. Therefore worth thinking whether refusal is an appropriate option for you.

            In many situations ‘medical events’ may occur that would not fit in with the definition of an ‘arrest’. In these situations an EHCP provides a means of documenting detailed and individual treatment decisions anticipating a future emergency. An EHCP is an advisory document and should allow the facts to be communicated in the event of an emergency. It should contain key information to avoid repetition, inform accurate management of your situation, no matter which care setting you are in. It can also include the use of anticipatory medication.

            Our first experience in receiving care is often from our family members, who might help with shopping, laundry or making meals. The first ‘care package’ might be brought in after a hospital stay, as part of your plan to return home. The hospital social work team will often be involved to assess your needs and ensure that you have practical help and support in place before you go home. Social Workers are part of the team that specialises in adult care, they can help arrange home care, access to care line and arrange for an occupational therapist to help you to get equipment that you might need in order to be able to manage at home.

            Unlike health services, <b>social care (non medical) is not free to everyone.</b> Many people pay in full or in part for the care they receive. Once the need for care is identified an assessment will be carried out to find out if you are entitled for help. If you are eligible for help, you will be told about costs. You should ask for a financial assessment, during which you will be asked for information about your income, assets and savings. You may be able to get help towards the cost of your social care.
          </p>
        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <p text-wrap text-center>
            If the financial assessment shows that you will not have to pay all of the cost yourself, you will be allocated a personal budget, which is made up partly of your money and partly the council’s money. You will use this budget to pay for the support described in your care and support plan. Depending on the type of care and support you are eligible for, different rates might apply. For example if you go into a nursing home and are assessed as being entitled to having all of your health care costs covered, you will still be responsible for paying your ‘hotel costs’, of room and food.

            It is illegal to gift your home or other assets to family members to avoid paying care home costs. If when undertaking your financial assessment, the local authority believes the money has been given away deliberately to avoid having to pay care home fees, an investigation can be launched into the circumstances. Under UK law, your local authority could claw the cash back if the gifts were made within six months of you entering care.

            If you have specific concerns about property, maybe you share your house with another family member or a vulnerable person, then simply changing from ‘joint tenants’ to ‘tenants in common’ can protect each persons share. It may be helpful to speak to a solicitor or financial advisor who can best advise on your particular situation.

            Social Work teams can also help you to find out about the different care package you might have available. It is possible to create complex care packages to allow someone to remain in their own home as long as it is safe and practical to do so. They can provide information on local care homes and waiting lists, and details on patient transport and many other support services. Social Work teams often work closely with medical staff and will support you through your decision making.
